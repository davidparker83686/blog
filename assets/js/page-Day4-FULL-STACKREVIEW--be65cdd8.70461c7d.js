College finals dont even hold that much weight. I also feel Incredibly shaky on c# so thats adding to alot of the stress i feel. I plan to time box and give myself brakes when I feel like giving up. This project is a Marathon not a sprint so I need to make sure I dont burn out. \nSo far Ive enjoyed all the new Knowledge Ive gained that has provided me with a Completely different view on sites that i didnt have before. Ive enjoyed the learning style alot with the lectures and actually Practicing in the lab being the main ways we learn considering I tend to have Difficulty learning Solely by reading. \n")])]),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"line-numbers-wrapper"},[a("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("1")]),a("br"),a("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("2")]),a("br")])]),a("p",[e._v("AFTERNOON-N/A")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
